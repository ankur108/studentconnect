        <h4 style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;color:#FFFD0D;">International Students</h4>
        <p>
          The University welcomes applications from international and EU students. Approximately 30% of students in Greenwich are International Students,so you won't be the first one.The
          University is itself International as Student from more than 140 countries comes every year
          to study. You will have the opportunity to meet people and make true friends from all continents,
          and that is just amazing.<br/><br/>
          Our team of International Student Advisers is here to help and advise on immigration issues and
          personal & welfare matters impacting on your studies. A free and confidential service is provided
          to all University of Greenwich international students.<br/><br/>
          Many students are concerned about being socially excluded because of their origin or level of
          English. However, this is not the case at the University of Greenwich. London is a very
          multicultural city, and Greenwich is the clearest example to see how friendship and
          tolerance are fully respected. I have never experienced any kind of racist/discriminatory
          experience, and I am sure Greenwich staff would strongly respond against and would condemn
          any kind of similar conduct.

        <h4 style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;color:#FFFD0D;">Erasmus+ Scheme</h4>
      <p>
        The University of Greenwich has participated in Study Abroad and Erasmus+ programmes for many
        years enabling incoming and outgoing students and staff to benefit from experiencing new
        countries and cultures.Students can choose from a wide range of host institutions in EU countries,
        such as the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Italy, among others.<br/><br/>
        All students who are accepted for Erasmus+ are considered for an Erasmus+ Grant, which is a
        contribution towards living costs whilst studying or working abroad.  The grant is based on
        monthly amounts, which vary from country to country. <br/>
</p>
        <span style="font-family:arial;font-style: italic;font-size:14px;">" In my case, I was chosen to study in the North of France
          during my second academic year.
        The Erasmus+ programme has been the best experience at university for me.
        I improved my French skills exponentially, made friends from France and from all over the
        world, got the chance to travel around Europe, explore some of the unknown Paris neighbours,
        and got used to French food.My Erasmus coordinator was always there to help me:
        I struggled a bit choosing modules and for credit conversion. He contacted the French
        university where I studied, and sorted it out! My grade conversion was in the end well done! "</span>

      <p>
                Got any Business Idea?
                        <br/>
      Greenwich can make it real with its excellent Entrepreneurship Challenges<br/><br/>
      The University of Greenwich hosts <span style="color:#fcf200;">Social Enterprise</span>
      and <span style="color:#fcf200;">Enterprise Challenge</span> every year for Greenwich
      Students only giving them a platform to pitch thier Business Idea and win
      a start-up investment of £1k-£3k and £5k repectively. It Happens every year, so even if you loose,
      you can still take part next year.
      </p>
      <span style="font-family:arial;font-style: italic;font-size:14px;">
        " I
applied for the Social Enterprise Challenge.
I partnered up with one of my classmates to
work on a Social Enterprise.
On passing stage 1, we were provided with a
mentor to work with us on our business plan.
Our mentor provided insightful observations
on how we could go about devising a
strategy and implementing our Social
Enterprise. We met our mentor regularly
based on our availability and prepared for
the finals.
During the finals, we had 10 mins to explain
our business idea to a panel of judges and
had 1 minute to pitch our idea to everyone
present for the final event. However, we
didn’t win any prizes but we gained a lot of
valuable knowledge with the help of our
mentor. We will apply again for Social
Enterprise this year! "
